# scrivx2pltr

## What it does

Creates a Plottr file from a Scrivener project.
All the scenes in the Scrivener project's Manuscript folder will show up as Scene Cards in Plottr, with their respective title and synopsis.


## What it doesn't do

It does not and never will synchronise between Plottr and Scrivener. 
Plottr can already export to Scrivener and they are supposedly [working on synchronisation](https://plottr.com/our-roadmap/), too.


## What it doesn't do yet

Export characters, places, and labels. Also, images.
I'd like to make some of this possible. Characters and places are effectively just free-form documents in Scrivener, whereas they are much more structured in Plottr. We'll see what's possible and how much sense it's going to make.


## Requirements

- Python 3
- [Scrivener 3](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview)
- a current version of [Plottr](https://plottr.com/) (they made some changes to the file format in early 2021)


## Caveats and Side Effects

- Haven't tested this on Windows.
- The file formats of both Scrivener and Plottr are undocumented. They may change at any time, breaking this script.
- Use at your own risk and always make backups first.


## Who wrote this?

My name is Dirk Haun. I used to be a software engineer but have been doing other things for the past 5+ years. I also haven't written any Python in as many years, so please bear with me.


## Which license is this under?

MIT License, for now. I may change my mind at a later point, but for now there isn't a lot here that's worth protecting anyway. It'll always be open source under an OSI-approved license, promised!
